# WebPage-qa

To do...

Got docker image of webpage QA. Can deploy externally (need to manually turn on firewall access to tcp:80)
Next, amend flask app so that can attach to backend service in kubernetes. See here: https://medium.com/@abhilashkjanardhanan/kubernetes-python-app-loadbalancer-connect-with-python-api-in-cluster-ip-service-75c7f433adc6
